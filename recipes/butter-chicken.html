    <li>2 tsp active dry yeast</li>
    <li>1 tsp sugar</li>
    <li>120ml lukewarm water</li>
    <li>1 pinch sugar</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>70g olive oil</li>
    <li>60g plain yoghurt</li>
    <li>290g all purpose flour</li>
    <li>1 1/2 tsp salt</li>
    <li>1 stick unsalted butter</li>
    <li>5 cloves minced garlic</li>
    <li>3/4 cup chopped cilantro</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <h3>For the butter chicken</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Slice the chicken breast into bite-sized pieces.</li>
    <li>Add <strong>half</strong> the garlic and ginger, along with the chili powder and some salt to the slices of chicken breast and marinate overnight <em>(optional)</em>.</li>
    <li>Add some oil to a pan and fry the chicken pieces.</li>
    <li>Transfer the chicken to a different bowl.</li>
    <li>Cut the onion roughly and add it back to the same pan, along with the butter (and also a bit of oil to prevent the butter from burning).</li>
    <li>After the onions start becoming translucent, add the tomatoes and cashew nuts, and let them cook for around ten minutes.</li>
    <li>Add some water and the rest of the garlic and ginger paste, along with the garam masala powder, honey and vinegar.</li>
    <li>Simmer for ~20 minutes (or until soft) before transferring to a blender and mixing until it becomes a smooth puree, orange in colour.</li>
    <li><em>(Optional)</em> Put the sauce through a strainer to ensure <strong>maximum smoothness</strong>.</li>
    <li>Remove the sauce from the blender and add the chicken back to the sauce along with some more buttern and mix everything together.</li>
  </ol>
  <h3>For the garlic naan</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>In a small bowl add the <em>lukewarm</em> water, yeast and sugar, and mix everything. Let it sit for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Add the egg, oil, and yoghurt and mix everything together.</li>
    <li>In another container, add the flour and start drizzling the wet mixture little by little <em>(while mixing)</em> until it is fully incorporated.</li>
    <li>Knead the dough until firm.</li>
    <li>Let the dough rest at room temperature in a large bowl lightly sprayed with oil for 40 minutes to one hour. Make sure it is covered with a towel.</li>
    <li>Cut the dough into small pieces and roll them until they are ~6mm thick.</li>
    <li>Add the butter stick and slices of butter in a small pan and place on heat until the butter is fully melted.</li>
    <li>To finish the garlic butter, add the chopped cilantro.</li>
    <li>To cook the naan, place the dough on a lightly-oiled skillet at high heat and cook for ~30 seconds before flipping and cooking for ~30 more seconds.</li>
    <li>Brush the garlic butter over the surface of the cooked naan and you're ready to go!</li>
  </ol>
