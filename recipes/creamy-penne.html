  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>An easy-to-make one-pot dish inspired by Italian cuisine.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>15g unsalted butter</li>
    <li>10ml olive oil</li>
    <li>1 brown onion, diced</li>
    <li>5 garlic cloves, minced</li>
    <li>60ml white wine</li>
    <li>200g swiss brown mushrooms</li>
    <li>1l chicken stock</li>
    <li>500ml thickened cooking cream</li>
    <li>350g penne</li>
    <li>50g parmigiano reggiano cheese, freshly grated</li>
    <li>5g parsley, roughly chopped</li>
    <li>120g baby spinach</li>
    <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Place the cooking fats on a large pan/pot along with the diced onion and sautee for a few minutes before adding the garlic and sauteeing for another minute.</li>
    <li>Add the white wine and stir to deglaze the pan. Toss the mushrooms along with some salt and sautee until the mushrooms have softened and the sauce has reduced.</li>
    <li>Pour the chicken stock, cream, salt and pepper on the same pan, and bring it to a boil. Then, add the pasta and reduce the heat. <strong>Important:</strong> taste the sauce as the pasta is cooking and adjust the seasoning accordingly.</li>
    <li>Add most of the parmigiano and parsley to the pan, leaving some for garnish. Add the baby spinach and mix.</li>
    <li>Once the sauce has thickened and the pasta is <em>al dente</em>, top the dish with the rest of the parmigiano and parsley, along with fresh cracked black pepper and a drizzle of olive oil. Ready to serve!</li>
