# Odin Recipes
## About
My first repository for The Odin Project. A miniature cookbook containing three of my most-often cooked meals:
- Butter Chicken
- Creamy Mushroom Penne
- Eggnog

Each recipe has a description, a list of ingredients, and a series of clearly labelled steps to cook the dish.

This project was done using **only HTML** according to the TOP curriculum until this lesson.
